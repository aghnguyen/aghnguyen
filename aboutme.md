Hi! My name is Allison Nguyễn. 


I am a psycholinguist deeply interested in understanding how people can shape the conversations they participate in. My work sits at the intersection of linguistic representation and spontaneous communication, with much of my work exploring how conversational effects arise from the interaction of semantic, pragmatic, and contextual factors. I employ a variety of methods in my work, including experimental methods, corpus analyses, and qualitative methods, as well as collaborating with psychologists across subfields, linguists across subfields and scholars in neighboring fields, such as computer science. Before becoming a graduate student, I did my undergraduate work at UCLA. I received my Master’s degree in Psychology in 2019 from UCSC. I will receive a MA in Linguistics from UCSC.
